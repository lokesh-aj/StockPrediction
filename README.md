# StockPrediction
This repository contains a Flask-based web application that visualizes and predicts stock prices using machine learning algorithms, including linear regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The app retrieves stock data from Yahoo Finance, processes it, and provides a graphical view of historical and predicted prices using matplotlib.
